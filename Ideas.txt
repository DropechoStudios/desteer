
Move steering behaviors into seperate classes so that they are more abstracted, only need calculate
on each steering behavior.  This would allow users to create pluggable behaviors in their own code.

Abstract localspace and mobile entity, have IMobileEntityWithLocalspace, mobile entity should have
function getLocalSpace, IMobileEntityWithLocalSpace should return this on that function.
